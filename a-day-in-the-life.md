SCENE 1: The Nightmare on Frew Street
-------------------------------------
 
(Klahr is lying in bed, tossing and turning in what appears
to be a restles sleep.  The dreamweavers enter making spooky,
dream-like music.  They form a line in front of Klahr and then part,
revealing Klahr in a telephone conversation)
 
Klahr:		Well, hello, Bobbie.  Good to hear from you.  How are
things at that end?  How did your colleagues take the news?
 
Klatzky: 	Well, David, that's actually why I called.  There's
been a minor change of plans.
 
Klahr:		(Puzzled) Well, what do you mean?  You won't be here
until August?
 
Klatzky:	Not exactly.  You see, my amateur surfing career has
just started to take off.  I took second in a freestyle competition
last weekend.  You should see my hang ten. AND, Al Michaels from ABC
Sports interviewed me for an upcoming special on the psychology of sport.
 
Klahr:		Hmmm.
 
Klatzky:	And, well, then there's the, uh, offer to be
chancellor of the University of Antarctica.  It's very attractive,
David.  Quite scenic, you know, and well frankly, sunnier.  I do love
penguins, real ones that is, not those brawling hockey types.
 
Klahr:		(Beginning to get nervous.)  Well, if it's more money,
then perhaps we could scrounge up some more.  Have a bake sale or
auction off a few grad students, something like that...
 
Klatzky:	That's terribly kind, David. I'd really appreciate it,
But every time I tell someone where we're moving, we get the same
response:  _PITTSBURGH_!!!! You're leaving paradise for
_PITTSBURGH_!!!  Have you gone mad?????
 
Klahr:		But, hey the 'burgh isn't a bad place.  There's plenty
to do.  I mean, last month thousands of people floated down the Mon in
bathtubs.  And for excitement, try swimming in the Allegheny.
 
Klatzky:	I'm sure that's true David.  But I've also been asked
to translate the Encyclopedia Brittannica into an obscure Aboriginal
dialect, and I will need to spend several months a year in the outback
for the next several decades in order to complete the project.  USAir
won't get me there.  I'm terribly sorry.  Someone else is far more
qualified than I am...You'll have to find a replacement for me....
 
Klahr:		(Desperate) Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
 
(Sleeping Klahr wakes up, visibly shaken.)
 
Klahr:		What a nightmare!  Thank god she's already here!  It's
too late for her to back out.  Time to start my last day as department
head.
 
(He hums "Zippadee Doo Da" as he gets ready for work.)
 
 
 
SCENE 2: Daddy, Can You Let me in the Basement?
-----------------------------------------------
 
(Daughter Klahr enters skipping.  She skips up to Klahr and starts
pulling on his shirt sleeve...)
 
Daughter:	Hi, Daddy!
 
Klahr:		What's up, pumpkin?
 
Daughter:	I'm not a pumpkin, Daddy, I'm a mammal.
 
Klahr:		Ok, my little mammal, what's up?
 
Daughter:	Daddy, could you let me in the basement?
 
Klahr:		I suppose so.  But, why do you want to go into the basement?
 
Daughter:	Daddy, _you_ of all people should know why!
 
Klahr:		(He nods, chuckling and patting her head, thinking he knows why
she wants to get in the basement) Going bike riding again?
 
Daughter:	Nope. I want to earn the Nobel Prize.
 
Klahr:		(Puzzled) Huhh?
 
Daughter:	(Exasperated) _Daddy_, I have to go to Snowbird.
 
Klahr:		(Says nothing, but looks increasingly baffled)
 
Daughter:	Well, that's where all the scientists shmooze, right?
To get a Nobel Prize, you _have_ to shmooze alot, Daddy.  Remember?  You
_always_ say that.
 
Klahr:		(Nods slowly, but says nothing).
 
Daughter:	Well, if I'm to go to Snowbird, I have to learn how to
ski first, right? 
 
Klahr:		(Shakes head slowly)
 
Daughter:	And in order to learn how to ski, I need to practice.
In order to practice I need my skis from the garage and my socks from
the dryer.  I can't get into the dryer in the basement unless you
unlock the door.
 
Klahr:		(Visibly shaken, mimes opening basement door.)
 
Daughter:	Thanks, Daddy.  See you in Stockholm! (she giggles and
goes off stage).
 
Klahr:		Bye pumpkin, I mean mammal.  My god, I've created a means-ends monster.
 
 
 
SCENE 3: Parking and the Perks of Office
----------------------------------------
 
(Klahr mimes getting into his car and driving to work. The scene takes
place in the Baker Hall parking lot.   Upstage are
two parking place markers with the names "Dr. David Klahr" and "Dr.
Herbert Simon."  Downstage left is a student playing the part of the
parking gate.  Klahr approaches the parking gate, says something
indistinguishable to the parking gate, and the gate arm rises,
permitting him entry to the parking lot.  He drives to his space.
 
At this point, Sheldon Cohen comes in from the opposite side of the
stage, and marches up to the parking gate.  He tries pushing the
gate's buttons, forcibly moving the gate's arms, even crawling under
the gate, but he is unable to pass.
 
Herbert Simon comes in on a skateboard...)
 
Herb:		Good morning, Sheldon.  May I get by you here?
Thanks.
 
Sheldon:	'Morning, Herb. (visibly frustrated)
 
Gate:		(To Herb)Answer me these questions three, ere the
other side you see...What is your name?
 
Herb:		Herbert A. Simon
 
Gate:		What is your quest?
 
Herb:		To answer one of the four great scientific questions.
 
Gate:		What is your favorite modelling methodology?
 
Herb:		EPAM, of course.
 
(Gatekeeper smiles broadly, raises arm, and Herb enters, parks
skateboard in parking place).
 
Sheldon:	(Looks gate in the eye with intent to maim)
 
Gate:		Answer me these questions three, ere the other side
you see...What is your name?
 
Sheldon:	Sheldon Cohen
 
Gate:		What is your quest?
 
Sheldon:	To determine the psychological factors that increase
susceptibility to infectious disease and to create interdisiplinary
fields whose names contain every letter of the alphabet.
 
Gate:		What is your favorite modelling methodology?
 
Sheldon:	I don't have one, dammit!  I'm a
psychoneuroendocrinimmunologist, don't you know.  We don't care about computers!
 
Gate:		If YOU DO NOT BRING ME A PROPER PSYCHOLOGICAL
MODELLING METHODOLOGY, YOU WILL NOT ENTER THIS PARKING LOT, ALIVE.
 
Sheldon:	(To Klahr) DAVID!  Help.
 
 
 
SCENE 4: The Student Psych Out
------------------------------
 
(Klahr at his desk, reading...Student knocks on door and peeks in...)
 
Terri:		Dr. Klahr? Hi, I'm here for our 10:00 meeting...
 
Klahr:		(Nods). Yes, Terri, come in and have a seat.  I was
just finishing up some paperwork...Whats on your mind?
 
Terri:		Well, I'm trying to design a follow-up experiment, and
I was hoping you could help me think through the details...
 
Klahr:		Go ahead.  (Klahr begins staring off in space and
continues to do so throughout the next series of lines).
 
Terri:		Well, as you know, I'm doing attention research.  I'm
interested in how stimuli capture attention.  For instance, if you are
driving down the highway, flashing police lights would draw attention
to your rearview mirror..
 
Klahr:		(Gazing off into the distance, voice over says)  Hmmm.  I remember the
last time I drove the turnpike.  Darn officer caught me going 85...
 
Terri:		I've worked out a nice priming paradigm in which
colors and word primes disrupt Stroop performance  (Puts graph in
front of Klahr (which Klahr ignores).  You can see symmetrical
interference effects...
 
Klahr:		(nods, strokes beard, voice over says...) I wonder
whether my hair appointment has been confirmed...better check on that...
 
Terri:		(Begins getting flustered, tries to get Klahr's
attention...) Basically I need to figure out if those interference
effects mean that I've really _captured_attention_ or if the subjects
are using some clever strategy...
 
Klahr:		(voice over) You know, I really need to think of a
joke for the departmental meeting...
 
Terri:		They could be ignoring...
 
Klahr:		(voice over) Let's see...knock-knock...Nah...too sophisticated...
 
Terri:		(Strains to get Klahr's field of view) I said they
could be ignoring the primes altogether...(Voice trails off)
 
Klahr:		(voice over) How about...There was a rabbi, a priest, and a
psychologist...Nah, too denominational
 
Terri:		(Frustrated but straining politeness...) Well I'm sure
you're very busy and I should let you get back to work.  Thanks for
letting me talk this out.
 
Klahr:		(voice over) I know, there once was a psychologist from
Nantucket...PERFECT!
 
(Terri takes graph off table, begins to walk away...)
	
Klahr:		(Aloud and directly to her) Terri, have you looked at
Logan's work on congruence?  Increasing the proportion of incongruent
trials would force subjects to pay attention...
 
Terri:		(Astounded he was actually listening throughout her
remarks) Thank you...I'd never thought of that. (she exits)
 
(Klahr gathers papers and follows Terri offstage)
 
 
 
SCENE 5: Hallway Arias
----------------------
 
(Klahr is on his way to the faculty meeting.  He meets a distraught
Herb Simon in the hallway."
 
Klahr:		Hi, Herb.  What's up?  You seem upset.
 
Herb:		(Looks wistfully into the distance) Well, David, I'll
tell you...
 
"Where Have All The Symbols Gone"		Herb Simon
 
    Where have all the symbols gone, long time passing?
    Where have all the symbols gone, long time ago?
    Where have all the symbols gone, gone to networks everyone.
    How do these damn things learn?  How do these damn things learn?  
            (holds up PDP diagram)
 
   (John Anderson enters, puts arm around Herb's shoulder, lights
lighter...60's do-wopp group enters and provides musical backup...)
 
    Where has our cognition gone, long time passing?
    Where has our cognition gone, long time ago?
    Where has our cognition gone, this is how we think? -- DREAM ON!!!
    When will they ever learn?  When will they ever learn?
 
(Do-woppers exit...)
 
Klahr:		I know how you feel, Herb. I miss those good old days,
too.  Remember when PDP was a hot new computer from DEC?
 
Herb:		Yeah, I sure do.  Hey, David, I've got a joke for you.
how many connectionists does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
 
Klahr:		Heard it already.  See you later, Herb. Cheer up,
okay? (Herb exits)
 
(Jon & Marlene drag themselves in, they look haggard
and bedraggled)
 
Klahr:		Jon, Marlene, you two look terrible!  Another night at
the MRI center!
 
Jon:		Night!  How about a decade!
 
"If We Only Had a Brain"			Jon Cohen & Marlene Behrman
 
    We could while away the hours, neglecting sleep and showers
        while we image them in vain
    Watch the thoughts they are thinking, I could be another Mishkin
        if we only had a brain.  (brain prop?) 
 
 
 
SCENE 6: Faculty Meeting
------------------------
 
(One by one, the faculty enter At the
last minute, John Anderson comes in, and stands off to the side.)
 
Lynne:		John, what are you doing here?  This is a faculty
meeting!  You don't come to faculty meetings, remember?
 
John:		I heard this was going to be a funny one.
 
(John sits down in a corner and begins to fidget, makes some sort of
structure out of pop cans...)
 
Klahr:		Welcome, everyone.  We have several critical issues to
discuss today, so let's get started. (puts up agenda slide 1.
Placement of Water Fountain, 2. Faculty Photographs in Lounge, 3.
Height of Faculty Mailboxes)
 
Yuko:		David, if you don't mind, the grad reps have a matter we'd
like to discuss first.
 
Klahr:		Sure, go ahead.
 
Yuko:		Well, as you know, the costs of photocopying have forced
recent cutbacks in the level of student stipends to $12 per year.
Dan Kimberg, for example, has had to give up his apartment, and is now
living in the Coke closet.
 
Marcel:		So, what's your point?
 
Yuko:		Well, we think the department should consider an
increase in the stipend by two orders of magnitude, or at the very
least, find some furniture for that closet...
 
Klahr:		Well, I don't know about that...Ken, will you chair a
subcommittee of the graduate program committee to look into it? 
 
Ken:		(startled) Shit! what? I mean, I just realized, oh hell, sure..
 
Klahr:		Thanks, We have more important matters to deal with
today...The issue: where should the new water fountain go?
 
(Jay walks in late...)
 
Jay:		Sorry to interrupt, but has anyone seen my rowing mug?
 
(no one responds, so Jay sits down and begins to twist his mustache,
frowns, squints, etc.)
 
Jill:		I've got it, let's use a diagram to explore the
problem space...Let's see, this is the third floor of Baker Hall, this
is the water fountain..Now, we have to find an operator....(starts
talking to herself and drawing a diagram while no one else listens)
 
(Jon Cohen's beeper goes off...he gets up and leaves the meeting)
 
Bob:		(Aside) Did you know that he has Teresa page him in the middle
of important meetings just to remind him to visit the facilities?
 
Klahr:		Folks, can we get back to the topic at hand?
 
Mike Scheier:	Which topic was _that_, David?  I'm not optimistic
about our finishing on time at this rate!
 
Klahr:		The drinking fountain!  Marcel, could you help us
remember what's been said thus far?
 
Marcel:		Sure.  go, mug, operator, facilities, hand, David,
rate, far...(high fives Pat)
 
Klahr:		Marcel...I'd hoped you would remember the _entire_
sentence, not just the last words.
 
Marcel:		Uh, Sorry...
 
Pat:		(comforts him) That's okay, Marcel, you did a great
job anyway.  I think that was a new record.
 
Peggy:		Basically, David, it comes to this...do we want to
establish exchange or communal norms...
 
Mike:		_that_ is a rhetorical question, I think.
 
Sheldon:	Is not...
 
Mike:		Is too...
 
Sheldon:	Is not...
 
Mike:		Is too...
 
Sheldon:	Is not...
 
Mike:		Dick?  Is that a rhetorical question?
 
Dick:		Oh, ummm, well, I guess it might be viewed in both
ways.  But, on the other hand, I must say that the current level of
acrimony among the faculty needs _moderated_.
 
Steve:		Uh, Dick, I think that's needs _mediated_...I mean,
needs _to_be_mediated_...(To audience) My God, I've only been here a year 
and I'm already talking like a 'burgher...
 
Brian:		You know in Navajo that phrase would be Koyannisqatsi.
 
Vicki:		This is a typical, male-type conversation...all talk, no
listening.
 
Klahr:		Well, folks, we're out of time.  I guess I'll just have to pick the
location myself...eenie, meeney, miney, moe, west wing, east wing, where
shall it go?  I'll let you know what I decide next time.  
 
 
 
SCENE 7: Go Tell it to the Barber
--------------------------------
 
(Klahr walks in, sits down in chair, barber puts robe on Klahr...)
 
Barber:		Hi, David, how's it been going?
 
Klahr:		Great, Gino.  What's new with you...
 
Barber:		Same old, same old, you know.  Hair today, hair
tomorrow... you know what I mean (chuckles...)  So tell me, how've you
been keeping busy?
 
Klahr:		Well, there's been the change in leadership in the
department...we've hired a new head...that's taken up quite a bit of
time.  And I've been doing quite a bit of work on my research, you
know.
 
Barber:		Oh?
 
Klahr:		Yes, well, we're developing a model of problem solving
in scientific discovery.
 
Barber:		I see.  Tell me more...
 
Klahr:		Well, the model is called Scientific Discovery as Dual
Search.
 
Barber:		Yes, and what does that mean...in layman's terms, of
course.
 
Klahr:		(slowly, deliberately )Well, basically, it means that
people get...hunches, which they check out.  And if that doesn't work out, they
 try
something else.  People go back and forth between their hunches to
find out what's really happening...
 
Barber:		(extremely fast) Oh...so you've actually developed an integrated model
of the scientific discovery process that involves hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and hypothesis evaluation. You
know, I'd be interested to know how this theory relates to Newell's
problem space searching in SOAR or Simon's & Lea's generalized rule
inducer. You should read my 1987 paper in Cognitive Science for a
recent review of the literature...
 
Klahr:		(Looks at audience, dumbfounded) I've got to change barbers!
 
 
 
SCENE 8: The Tower of Glower
----------------------------
 
(Margaret Kinsky enters with three stacks of paperwork which she
places on the table in a basket labelled "IN", she places a second
basket labeled "OUT" on the table and puts her head in her hands.
Klahr notices her and begins speaking)
 
Klahr:		Margaret, what's the matter?
 
Margaret:	It's this paperwork, David.  I don't see how I'll ever
finish.  These grants must be filed in the next hour, and they have to
be done in this exact order.  Of course, I'm only human, so I can only
work on one of them at a time.  And just look at the stack!  I'm
incredibly annoyed.
 
Klahr:		Yes, I see what you mean.  Hmmm. (deep in thought) One
stack, three items, Margaret annoyed...annoyed...That's it! (to
audience, very exaggerated...) IT'S THE TOWER OF ANNOYED!
 
(Klahr quickly moves to solve problem...)
 
Margaret:	Oh, David, you're a wonder.  Come into my problem
space any day!
 
(Margaret exits)
 
Klahr:		I knew that damn puzzle would come in handy some day!
 
 
 
SCENE 9: Departmental Annual Meeting 
-------------------------------------
 
Klahr:		Welcome to the annual department meeting.
You know, we've made remarkable progress again this year, and since
this is my last time to give this presentation, I wanted to show you
_just_ how special you all are... 

(goes into presentation of graphs) (ad lib comments)
Summary stats:
  Income pie chart: mix of psycoke, grants, & begging
  Expenses pie chart: mix of photocopying, faculty salaries, parties,
    & graduate student stipends
  Breakdown of photocopying expenses: articles never read, own articles, other
  New things in the department: one new hairstyle, zero new ideas

Trend analyses:
  Curious trend: strong positive correlation between trees killed in a year
    and number of dissertations in the that same year.
  Student stipends + student productivity over time: both positive increasing
  Faculty salaries + faculty productivity over time: salaries increasing,
    productivity constant

Klahr:		I'm also proud to report that Several faculty members
have made significant progress in their research this past year, and
to give you a flavor for that progress I'd like to invite Sheldon
Cohen to the podium to tell us a bit about his current research.
 
Sheldon:	Thank you, David.  Essentially, I'm examining how
perceived stress levels interact with objective stressors to put
individuals at increased risk of infection by rhinoviruses.
 
Audience mem:	Dr. Cohen, Dr. Cohen!!  May I ask you a question?  I am
not sure that I completely understand what it is that you are
attempting to say to us here?  Do you mean...
 
   "Music from Adelaide's Lament"
 
   The ordinary average subject,
      when to certain stimuli exposed,
   linking health to perceived stress levels may react...
 
   By developing various symptoms
      of the eyes, ears, throat, and nose,
   that is, of the upper respiratory tract...
 
   In other words if conditions are right
      and depending on what they're told,
   The subject will develop a cold.
 
   If you tell them things are peachy
      and that life's divine
   without any regard to the truth
      they seem to turn out fine,
   but let 'em perceive they got problems
      and you can be sure each time
   the subject (sneeze) will develop a cold...
 
Sheldon:	Precisely.
 
Klahr:		Thank you Sheldon. And, hey, you ought to give that
gal a job!  Well, I guess that's it folks!  My tenure's over, I'm out of here, 
adios,
arrivadercci, gone, absent, finished, fine, done, complete, ended,
terminal, kicked upstairs, booted, gonzo, wasted,...
 
Audience:	(Interrupting Klahr) David, don't you think we should
welcome the new department head?
 
Klahr:		You're absolutely right! Please everyone, put your hands to together
to help welcome our new department head...HELLO, BOBBIE KLATZKY!!!!
 
Segue into full cast rendition of "Hello, Bobbie"
 
(Head bob in time to the music...)
    Hello Bobbie, well hello Bobbie, 
       its so nice to have you here where you belong.
    You're looking swell, Bobbie, we can tell, Bobbie,
        you'll be glowing, we'll be growing, we'll be going strong.
 
    We searched around, Bobby, and we found, Bobbie
        you're the only one to do the job, AMEN!
    SO -- its a snap, Bobbie,
        don't ever take no crap, Bobbie.
    (Klahr only) Bobbie don't ever go away
    (Chorus)     Bobbie don't ever go away
                 Bobbie don't ever go away again.
 
 
(Massive applause)
